# R for Data Science

This repository contains the scripts I use to learn R based on the book R for Data Science by Hadley Wicham & Garret Grolemund, available online at [https://r4ds.had.co.nz/](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/). 

# Organization

There's one script for each chapter containing examples and exercises from the book that I do for practice and some other things that pop in my head during practice.
