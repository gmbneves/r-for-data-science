# R for Data Science

This repository contains the scripts I use to learn R based on the book [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) by Hadley Wicham & Garret Grolemund. There's one script for each chapter containing examples and exercises from the book that I do for practice and some miscelaneous things that pop in my head during my practice.
